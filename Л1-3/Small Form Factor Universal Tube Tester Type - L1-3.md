#### 5. Description of the Schematic Diagram

###### 5.1. The device consists of the following units:
- Power supply;
- Steepness meter (tube voltmeter and generator);
- Microammeter;
- Switching device.

###### 5.2. Power supply.

The power supply of the device (see the schematic diagram) consists of a power transformer Tr, kenotron rectifiers, one rectifier on semiconductor diodes, and three voltage stabilizers.

The rectifier, assembled on tube 5Ц4М (Л3), provides stabilization of the constant voltage on the anode and the second grid of the tested tube, as well as on the steepness meter. The rectifier has three electronic stabilizers.

The electronic stabilizer for stabilizing the anode voltage of the tested tube consists of two tubes 6П1П (Л1 and Л2) and one tube 6Ж4П (Л4). The rectified voltage is smoothly regulated from 5 to 300 volts by potentiometer R76.

The electronic stabilizer for stabilizing the voltage on the second grid of the tested tube consists of tube 6П1П (Л8) and 6Ж4П (Л9). The voltage of the second grid is smoothly regulated from 10 to 300 volts by potentiometer R112.

The electronic stabilizer for powering the steepness meter is assembled on tubes 6П1П (Л16) and 6Ж4П (Л17). Regulation of the voltage is performed by potentiometer R169. Part of the voltage is taken from the output of the stabilizer, used to calibrate the microammeter.

The schematics of the three stabilizers are identical. Tubes Л1, Л2, Л8, and Л16 serve as regulating elements, they are connected in series with the loads, and tubes Л4, Л9, and Л17 serve as amplifiers of the direct current from the reference voltages coming from the stabilizers Л6 and Л7.

During the increase (decrease), of the output voltage a negative voltage (relative to the cathode) controlling the grid also increases (decreases), as a result the tube DC resistance increases (decreases) as well as the the voltage drop across the tube.

The second rectifier, assembled on tube 6Ц4П (Л5) at the output of which there are gas-discharge stabilizers СГ15П-2 (Л6 and Л7), is a reference voltage for electronic stabilizers and is used as a bias voltage on the grid 1 of the tested tube.

---

The third rectifier, assembled on tubes 6Ц4П (Л11) and СГ15П-2 (Л10), is the power source for the tube microammeter.

The fourth rectifier, assembled on semiconductor diodes Д214Б (Д1-Д4) in a bridge circuit, powers the heater circuits of the tested tubes with direct current. The adjustment of the heater voltage is performed by potentiometers R32 and R33.

Changes in the voltage on the secondary winding of the transformer due to changes in the mains voltage are compensated by changing the number of turns in the primary winding of the power transformer using the switch B6. Control of the voltage on the secondary winding of the transformer is performed indirectly.

The rectified voltage from the anode of tube Л5 through resistor R85 is supplied to the measuring device when the "Network" button is pressed (КП12).

###### 5.3. Steepness meter

The steepness meter is designed to measure the slope of the anode-cathode characteristic of receiving-amplifying and low-power generating tubes.

The electrical circuit of the tube steepness meter consists of:
- Generator 1400 ± 50 Hz;
- Tube voltmeter.

The 1400 Hz generator is assembled on tube 6Н3П (Л15) in the RC-generator circuit with a Wien bridge. Frequency adjustment within narrow limits is performed by changing the resistance of one of the resistors using potentiometer R155.

The adjustment of the output voltage of the generator is performed by changing the depth of negative feedback using potentiometer R157.

The voltage from the cathode of the second half of tube Л15 is fed to the divider, the anode load, and the divider, where it is measured by the tube voltmeter.

The tube voltmeter is designed to measure the voltage amplitude with a frequency of 1400 Hz, taken from the anode circuit of the tested tube.

---

In the voltmeter, a selective amplifier is used, assembled on tubes 6Ж4П — 2 pcs. and 6Н3П — 1 pc. (Л12, Л13, and Л14).

To achieve high selectivity, the amplifier uses two double T-shaped bridges. For rectification, diodes of the Д106А type (Д9, Д10), working in a doubling circuit, are used. For amplifier stabilization, negative feedback is applied, which is fed through double T-shaped bridges.

Calibration of the steepness meter is done by applying a 120 mV voltage from the generator divider through the B5 toggle switch to the input of the tube voltmeter.

This system ensures the accuracy of measurements is maintained regardless of changes in the sensitivity of the voltmeter or generator voltage over time.

###### 5.4. Microammeter

The tube microammeter is assembled on the 6Н3П tube (Л18) in a balanced circuit. It is designed to measure the reverse current of the first grid, anode current at the beginning of the characteristic, and leakage current between electrodes. When measuring current, the dial gauge device is connected between the cathode and the anode of tube Л18.

The balancing circuit, i.e., zeroing of the device, is done using potentiometer R123. Calibration of the tube microammeter, i.e., adjusting sensitivity, is performed using potentiometer R125 when a stabilized voltage of 250 V is applied to the microammeter divider R93 - R99 through resistor R102.

###### 5.5. Switching Device

The switching device includes all tube panels (19 units), the unit of the tube switch, switch B1 and B2, buttons (KП1, KП2), toggle switches (B4 and B5), a microammeter of the M24 type with a load capacity of 150 µA, a shunt system and additional resistors, and a protection system of the device, that trips during an overload event, not exceeding a 5 times of the nominal scale.

The switching device is the main commutation and control unit together with it's set of test cards that are to be placed on the commutator.

The stubs are to be inserted into the holes on the test card, this will ensure an error proof connection to all the electrodes of the tubes, the required test voltages, and the inclusion of the corresponding scales of the measuring device.
